Tensions between America and China are growing. 

Conflict appears inevitable and that means a bumpy road for the whole world. Since we do not teach anything about China in America, let's learn about China and take a look at recent events that brought us here. 

The first and absolute most important thing Americans need to know about China is that the Chinese people are wondeful not an enemy. It's the CCP that we need to be concerned about.

CCP = Chinese Communist Party
