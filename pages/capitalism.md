U.S. capitalism is out of balance and the CCP will try to topple us. We need a high quality conversation that occurs in the public forum. How the US reacts will decide the next decade. Buckle up.

There is a big move coming. The question everyone should be asking is "What happens if the dollar loses its place as the world reserve currency?"
